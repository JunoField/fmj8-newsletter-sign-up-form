## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - frontend JS library
- Vite - a global Node module used to create a React app.


### Continued development

This is my first React project that hasn't used React Bootstrap, so I'm not 100% sure whether the way I've done CSS is the most appropriate for a React project. Any feedback would be appreciated.
